  <h2>Connect Four API Documentation</h2>
  This API is for the Connect Four game. The game simply implements Connect Four for two players. When you include connectfour.js a global variable is created called connectfour. All methods should be called on this object. For example, we can make a move by doing <b>connectfour.makeMove("R1C2")</b> Below you can find the API:<br><br>
